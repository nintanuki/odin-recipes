    Welcome to my first website! This is my solution to the
    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes">Recipes</a> project of the
    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes">Foundations Course</a> of
    the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">Odin Project</a>
    The goal of this project is to demonstrate the skills I have learned with HTML so far,
    as well as added CSS as I make further progress in The Odin Project.

    This is just a short list of some of my favorite recipes.
    Click the links below to read them.

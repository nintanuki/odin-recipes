  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    This recipe is for making banana bread with chopped walnuts.
    You can find the original recipe
    <a href="https://www.landolakes.com/recipe/20643/walnut-banana-bread/">here</a>.
    It's cheap and easy to make. Every week when I go grocery
    shopping, I buy a bunch of bananas to bring to work for lunch,
    and at the end of the week I make banana bread with the bananas
    that are left over. The recipe calls for <strong><em>two</em></strong> bananas
    but you can use <strong><em>three</em></strong> bananas,
    it might just be a little more moist.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also <strong>freeze</strong> the bananas to preserve them
    before making the bread, the peels will turn orange. The bananas will
    liquify making it difficult to peel them so I recommend peeling them
    before freezing them, and also slicing them first too. Be sure to
    properly <strong><em>defrost</em></strong> them before using them.

    I personally like to melt the butter slowly in a sauce pan first,
    rather than use a microwave. Remember 1/2 a cup of butter is <strong>just
      a stick of butter.</strong> I do not <em>"flour"</em> the pan
    I just spray it down with olive oil. I personally like to
    use 1 cup of white all purpose flour and 1/2 of whole wheat flour. You
    can substitute chocolate chips for walnuts if you want
    chocolate chip banana bread.
